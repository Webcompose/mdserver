Program mdurlcheck checks whether given markdown files have any broken
relative links to other files.

It takes one or more .md files or directories as its arguments, then finds
relative links (including image links) to other files/directories in them
and checks whether such files/directories exist on the filesystem. If
argument is directory, it recursively traverses this directory in search of
.md files, while skipping directories with names starting with dot.

Provided with the following file:

    [Document 1](doc1.md), [document 2](doc2.md), and [another
    one](dir/doc.md)

    ![program illustration](img/screenshot.jpg "Screenshot")

The program will check whether files doc1.md, doc2.md, dir/doc.md, and
img/screenshot.jpg exist on disk, relative to the location of provided file.

Program reports any errors on stderr and exits with non-zero exit code.
